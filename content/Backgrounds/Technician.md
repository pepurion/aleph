### Description
Whether a humble lostworlder blacksmith or an astronautic engineer, you made a career out of building and mending the fruits of technology. While almost every society has a need for such services, not all of them treat their providers as generously as a one might wish. A skilled technicianâ€™s expertise is always useful to a group that plans to rely on anything more sophisticated than a sharpened stick.
