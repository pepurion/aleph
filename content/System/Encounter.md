## Initiative:
Roll **d100** on Dexterity.

- Success: You act before your opponents
- Failure: You act after your opponents

All players act simultaneously and so do all opponents.
If more than two parties are involved, teams act together. The order is based on average initiative successes.

---
## Actions:
By default, every turn you have: 

- **1 Action** (MA / BA) 
- **2 Small Actions** (mA / SA)

### Action
- Main action of a turn (e.g. throwing, typing, attacking)
- Can be converted into 2 Small Actions
- Can be used to prepare an action to be activated with a Small Action

### Small Action
- Quick action in a small timeframe (e.g. grabbing, pushing a button, reacting)
- A total of 1 can be saved to use outside of your turn

---
## Movement
You can walk using Small Action or run using Action.

- Default movement speed is **2m** per Small Action.
- Running speed is **5m** + **Dex/10** per Action

While moving, you can change the direction of default movement, but not running. You cannot save excess movement distance.

---
## Sneaking
You can use a Small Action to reduce your visibility or noise during a turn.

- For every turn of sneaking, use a Small Action and roll **Dexterity** check
- On Failed check every applicable opponent rolls an opposing **Perception** check
- While being right next to an opponent, they roll an additional **Perception** check, regardless of your roll's outcome

---
## Attacking
If you use an Action to attack, you roll **Combat** check. On Success you roll damage. There is NO CRITICAL DAMAGE by default.

### Melee
Standard melee attack's damage is **d(Str/10)** when unarmed.
Melee weapon adds it's damage to the damage roll.

### Ranged
There are 3 firing modes.

 - Single - you shoot 1 precise shot, gain **Assist** on **Combat** check
 - Semi-auto - you shoot a couple of bullets at the opponent, default for rifles
 - Auto - you shoot a barrage in a general direction, roll **Combat** check per 4 shots up to 3 times with **[-]**

Damage is rolled per projectile and is indicative of the hit spot. Reloading is 1 Action. 

Weapons have an effective range.

- Pistol - 10 meters
- Shotgun - 10 meters
- Rifle - 25 meters

Shooting beyond a weapon's effective range adds 1 **Obstacle** to **Combat** check for each multiple of its range exceeded (e.g. Pistol 1m-10m = 0, 11m-20m = 1, 21m-30m = 2...)

Additionally you can get **Assist** by having a stable position while shooting.

### Surprise Attack
If you are Sneaking and unnoticed, you gain **[+]** on a melee **Combat** check.

---
## Defending
If you have a free Small Action, you can react to an incoming attack that you are aware of. By default you can react to a melee attack or a thrown object.

### Block
One out of two options to react to an attack is to block it. 

You roll your [[Attributes#Block Rating|Block Rating]], reducing the damage dealt by the rolled value, up to a minimum of 1 damage dealt as the result. 

### Dodge
Second option to react to an attack is to dodge it.

You roll your [[Attributes#Dodge Rating|Dodge Rating]].

- If the roll is equal to or higher than the damage that would be dealt to your health, all damage is prevented
- If the roll is lower, damage is fully dealt
