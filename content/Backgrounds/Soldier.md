### Description
Your character was a professional fighter, whether a barbarian noble’s bodyguard, a faceless conscript in a planetary army or an elite soldier in the service of a megacorp’s private military. Whether it was because they were on the losing side, choosing to leave or being forced to flee a cause, they now find themselves navigating a world where their most salable skill is one that can cause them a great deal of trouble.
