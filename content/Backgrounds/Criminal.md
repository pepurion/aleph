### Description
Whether thief, murderer, hacker, smuggler, spy or some other variety of malefactor. Some such rogues are guilty only of offending a planetary lord, while others have done things that no civilized society could tolerate. Their ability to navigate the perils of a less-than-legal adventure can make them attractive associates for a party of freebooters bent on profit and glory more than strict legality.
