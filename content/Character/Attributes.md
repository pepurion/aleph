## Health
A character has 2 types of HP. First is **Health**.

- Health - physical wellbeing
- Wound - represents the number of Health bars

When your HP is depleted, you gain a Wound and regain HP. If the damage dealt was higher than the remaining HP, the overflow damage is divided by 2 and transferred to the next Wound.
For each Wound gained, you are harmed based on the damage you sustained, roll on [[Wound table]]. On gaining the last one, roll Death Save. 
Death save is a single secret DM roll **d20** on your condition, 10 and higher you will wake up eventually, 9 and lower you need help, 1 you die. The severity is determined by the DM.

Second is **Sanity**. Depending on species this may vary.

- Sanity -  psychological wellbeing

Sanity can be depleted via mental attacks, cognitive exhaustion and low morale. When it is depleted, roll on [[Panic Table]], after that restore **d4** Sanity.

## Defense
To reduce or negate incoming physical damage, you have **Block Rating**, **Dodge Rating** and additionally **Armor**.

### Block Rating
The amount of damage you can block.
Measured in one or more **d4**.

### Dodge Rating
The amount of damage you can dodge.
Measured in one or more **d12**.

### Armor
Armor you are wearing has Armor Points **AP** and Damage Reduction **DR**

- **AP** determines the durability of armor
- **DR** is a passive damage reduction of armor

If the armor has X amount of **AP**, any damage below X is ignored. Damage equal to or higher than X destroys the armor and any remaining damage is dealt to the character. After that the armor looses all **AP**.
If the armor has **DR**, any incoming damage is first reduced by this stat, then applied to armor or character. **DR** works even if the armor was destroyed.
