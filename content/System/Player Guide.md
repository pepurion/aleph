Guide to creating a character for players. **WIP**

## X. "Uses" Tab
This is something I think is really fucking useful, but not all may use. This is essentially a clear and compact list of all abilities or items that have a limited use, all in one place. With that you don't need to scroll through the file just to see what you have and to calculate how many uses it has left.
You may also add just general actions that may be left forgotten otherwise.

Here's an example from one of my character files:

	Shield HP: {9600/15k}       L rest
	Lay on Hands: {28/75}       L rest
	Spell Slots: {8/8}          3/L rest
	Human Determination: {1/1}  S-L rest
	Channel Divinity: {1/1}     S-L rest

If you don't already have a place, where you keep track of these things, please use it. It would be easier for you and me to keep track of your things.

## X. Character Info
Everything about your character that you want to add. Age, height, backstory, favorite drink, hobby, smell, any info you acquired and whatnot.

I mean... You *can* copy this there, *buuuuuutttt...* take only what you need...

	Sex:
	Age:
	Height:
	Hand:
	Attraction:
	Fetishes:
	Fears:
	Loves:
	Hates:
	Motivation:
	Theme:

Hi~
It is I, Pepperoni, leaving a quick message. More of a notice really.
Aleph is not a finished system. But not because it's buggy and unbalanced (that might still be true), but because it is set to be played in an ever-expanding universe. As the story of Aleph-zero progresses, the system has to expand too with new species, talents, classes, whatever.
If something is unbalanced or "is shit", well that's just because it was put together by one guy that usually skips the "character build" step in games and just goes with whatever works and is fun to play.
What I'm trying to say is... If you have an idea, suggestion, remark, opinion, then go on, tell me, don't hold back, I can take it, it's just a silly game after all, we'll figure something out.
Ok bye
