Some actions require stat checks for Strength, Dexterity, Perception, Intellect or Combat. 

- Roll [d100] for a stat
- You succeed if you hit your stat value or lower
- If the relevant stat value is less than 10, it is an automatic Fail

The roll and goal values can be modified.

- If you have applicable talents or equipment, you gain [Bonus] on a roll
- If you have a negative effect, you may gain [Penalty] on a roll
- If there's something that helps the roll, you gain [Assist] and subtract [d20] from the roll
- If there's something that interferes, you gain [Obstacle] and add [d20] to the roll
- If the action is very easy/difficult by itself, you roll with [+] / [-] respectively

[Assist] and [Obstacle] cancel each other out.
If you hit an extreme value (1, 100) or doubles (11, 22, 33...) on d100, it's a [critical]. If you succeed in a roll, it's a critical success, if not - critical fail.

If someone is helping you, they roll a plain stat check themselves.

- Crit Success - you gain 2 [Assist]
- Success - you gain 1 [Assist]
- Fail - nothing happens
- Crit Fail - you gain 1 [Obstacle]

If someone is against your action, they can [oppose] your roll if they have an available Small Action. If the opponent gets a better result, they successfully oppose and your action is canceled or the result changes.

Rolls for Body and Mind are largely considered [Saves]. They are rolled the same as other stats, but they are not affected by normal modifiers, only special [Talents] affect them.
